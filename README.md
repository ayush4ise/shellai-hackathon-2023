# ðŸš€ Shell.ai Hackathon 2023 Attempt

This repository documents my endeavors to address a partial segment of the problem statement presented during the Shell.ai Hackathon 2023 on HackerEarth.

## Description

Focused efforts were made to address a portion of the problem statement. Unfortunately, persistent "Out of Memory" errors were encountered while utilizing gurobipy and CPLEX, obstructing the successful derivation of a viable solution.

## Revised Approach

In light of the challenges faced, I plan to adopt a different strategy, suggested by an IM Alum. Utilizing clustering techniques recommended by them, we aim to refine and narrow down the potential locations effectively.

**Note:** Ensure the file path in the .dat file for the CPLEX part is updated accordingly.

## Future Steps

I intend to explore the application of clustering methods to refine potential locations, incorporating insights suggested by the IM Alum. Additionally, I'll be delving into the application of `ortools` by Google, considering its potential in addressing the challenges faced earlier.
